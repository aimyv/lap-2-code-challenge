# stash. - Lap 2 Code Challenge

## Description

This application allows users to share their thoughts with others. It consists of a register page, login page and dashboard. If a user attempts to register with a username that's already present in the database, they will be instructed to try again with a different username via an alert. Similarly, if they attempt to login with an incorrect username or password. At the top of their dashboard, they can submit a post via a form. Below this, they can view their feed. Users have the option to submit their post anonymously. Clicking the anon toggle on the form will list 'anonymous' on the post whereas leaving it free will list their username on the post. Once a post has been submitted, it will be displayed on their feed in reverse chronological order.
